Hello !

It's been a long time.

I'm not reading at the speed I used to, but I'm still reading !

# The Piano Teacher
### Elfriede Jelinek

Sarah and Renee and Tomy and I were thinking how few Nobel winners we've read, but we weren't sure how to choose one.  Any criteria seemed pretty arbitrary.  So I printed out all the Literature Nobel Winners since the beginning and cut each one into a little strip and had a disinterested third party draw a name out of a hat. On camera, testifying this was the first draw, etc, etc.  And the name which came up was your good friend [Theodor Mommsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Mommsen), who won the prize in 1902.

Mommsen's work, [The History of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Rome_(Mommsen)) is difficult to find, but we dutifully found it and read a couple chapters but it was way too dated (ie racist) to stomach, so we abandoned that.   The Nobel Laureate Project languished for a while, but then Sarah just said she was reading **The Piano Teacher**.
